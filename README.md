# C_language

This repository was made to keep my work for the C_language
C is the language that can make learning of all other languages easy. It gives the foundation of programing languages
In this repo we focus on the key areas of c language ie. variables, functions, loops, conditional statements.
This repo has the notes file that contain all the notes that were taken during the lectures of cs50 classes
